Medium,What is a key architectural difference in how Behavior Trees (BT) and State Machines (SM) manage their logic flow?,"SMs are hierarchical, while BTs use a flat structure of independent nodes.","BTs can only be implemented in C++, while SMs are Blueprint-only.",SMs are always more performant than BTs due to their simplicity.,"BTs are hierarchical and polled from the root each tick, while SMs are flat and transition based on events.",D
