Question,Answer,Difficult
"For creating a simple, reactive AI like an automatic door that can only be in an 'Opening', 'Open', 'Closing', or 'Closed' state, a Finite State Machine is often a more straightforward and efficient choice than a Behavior Tree.",True,Easy
"In a Behavior Tree, node priority is evaluated from right to left.",False,Easy
A NavMesh Bounds Volume must be placed in a level to define the areas where the navigation mesh will be built.,True,Easy
"Navigation Invokers are primarily used to generate a small, high-detail NavMesh for cinematic sequences rather than for gameplay in large worlds.",False,Easy
"In an EQS Test, a 'Filter' purpose will completely discard items that do not meet its criteria.",True,Easy
The primary purpose of the Environment Query System (EQS) is to help an AI agent gather information about its environment to make better decisions.,True,Easy
The 'Querier' in an EQS query always refers to the AI pawn that is executing the query.,True,Easy
"If the 'bOrientRotationToMovement' property on a Character Movement Component is set to true, the Character's mesh will automatically rotate to face the direction of its current velocity.",False,Easy
Setting the 'MaxWalkSpeed' on a Character Movement Component also limits the character's maximum speed when they are in the 'Flying' or 'Swimming' movement modes.,False,Easy
"Smart Objects are essentially markers placed in a level that AI agents can interact with, allowing for complex behaviors without needing custom AI logic for every single interactive object.",True,Easy

Directly setting the World Transform of the Player Camera Manager is the standard method for instantly changing the player's viewpoint to a new location and rotation.,False,Easy

"Setting Global Time Dilation to 0.0 is a common and effective way to pause all game simulation, including actor ticks, physics, and timers.",True,Easy
