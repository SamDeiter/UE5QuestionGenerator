**Task:** Perform a comprehensive user interface (UI) review on the currently running local application.

**Steps:**
1.  **Launch Browser:** Start the application in the Browser Agent and navigate to the component or page specified by the user.
2.  **Visual Analysis:** Analyze the page for layout issues, visual bugs, poor responsiveness, and adherence to the design principles (if a rule or file for design principles is provided).
3.  **Artifact Generation:** Take a **"before" screenshot** of the current state.
4.  **Suggest Fixes:** Generate a list of 3-5 high-priority suggested fixes (e.g., "The submit button is off-center," "The font size on the sidebar is too small").
5.  **Execution Plan:** Generate a detailed Implementation Plan artifact outlining the code changes needed for the **first two** suggested fixes.
6.  **Fix and Verify:** Execute the code changes for those two fixes.
7.  **Final Artifacts:** Generate an **"after" screenshot** showing the corrected UI.

**Output Format:** Deliver the final result as a markdown artifact that contains the list of suggested fixes and the before/after screenshots for the executed changes.
