* When generating files, follow a PascalCase naming convention for React components and snake_case for Python modules.
* Always add relevant generated files (including documentation and tests) to the .gitignore file unless specifically instructed otherwise.
* Before generating code, check the existing project files for any similar or redundant utility functions. Refactor or reuse instead of creating duplicates.
