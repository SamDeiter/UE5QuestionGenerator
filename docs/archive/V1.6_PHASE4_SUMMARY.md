# Phase 4 Summary: User-Created Tags

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** December 4, 2025

## 1. Feature Overview
We have implemented a full **Tagging System** to allow for granular control over question generation and organization.

### Key Components
- **Tag Manager:** Define custom tags per discipline (e.g., `#Lumen`, `#Nanite` for *Technical Art*).
- **Generation Logic:** Select "Focus Tags" in the sidebar to guide the AI to generate questions about specific sub-topics.
- **Filtering:** Filter the Review List by tags to quickly find specific content.
- **Data Persistence:** Tags are saved to your user profile in Firestore.
- **Question Metadata:** Generated questions now store the tags used during their creation.

## 2. Changes Made
- **UI Refactor:** 
  - Moved **Creativity (Temperature)** settings to the **Settings Modal** to declutter the sidebar.
  - Added **Tag Selector** to the Sidebar for generation.
  - Added **Tag Filter** to the Context Toolbar for review.
- **Logic:**
  - Updated `useGeneration.js` to inject selected tags into the system prompt.
  - Updated `questionFilters.js` to logic to filter by tags (OR logic).
  - Updated `App.jsx` to manage tag filter state.

## 3. How to Use
1. **Create Tags:** Open **Settings > Custom Tags** and add tags for your discipline.
2. **Generate:** In the Sidebar, select the tags you want to focus on (e.g., select `#Lumen`).
3. **Review:** Use the **Filter Tags** button in the toolbar to show only questions with specific tags.

## 4. Next Steps
