# Agent Guidelines

This document outlines the roles and responsibilities for AI agents working on this project.

## Core Principles
1. **User-Centric**: Always prioritize the user's request and experience.
2. **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards for code readability, performance, and robustness.
3. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

## Workflows
- **Planning**: Before implementing complex features, create an implementation plan.
- **Execution**: Follow the plan, testing as you go.
- **Verification**: Verify changes with tests or manual checks.

## Tools
- Use `task_boundary` to track progress.
- Use `notify_user` for critical communication.
